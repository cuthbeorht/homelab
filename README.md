# How I configured Dynamic DNS

## Configure the Registrar

- First, I went to Google Domain's DNS section of the domain I want to forward to my home server.
- Next, I created an A record
- I needed to install ddclient
- I configed it using dyndns2 with the following config:

```text
# Configuration file for ddclient generated by debconf
#
# /etc/ddclient.conf

protocol=dyndns2
use=web
server=domains.google.com
login=username
password='my_secret_password'
davidsciacchettano.dev
ssl=yes
```

Note: Credentials are found in Google's DNS section for Dynamic routing

- Finally, restart the servier `service ddclient restart`

# Exposing Plex

## Copy Config

Swag provides pre-configured Nginx conf files for reverse proxies. I took the one for plex as a subfolder and, 
since plex is running in host network mode, just pointed my browser to my domain/plex. 

However, I thought against leaving it public since I don't want to expose my music library... yet.

## Next Steps

- Figure out how to lock down Plex so only I can access it. Until then I am leaving it running in my network but not exposed to the web.
