# How I configured Dynamic DNS

## Configure the Registrar

- First, I went to Google Domain's DNS section of the domain I want to forward to my home server.
- Next, I created an A record
- I needed to install ddclient
- I configed it using dyndns2 with the following config:

```text
# Configuration file for ddclient generated by debconf
#
# /etc/ddclient.conf

protocol=dyndns2
use=web
server=domains.google.com
login=username
password='my_secret_password'
davidsciacchettano.dev
ssl=yes
```

Note: Credentials are found in Google's DNS section for Dynamic routing

- Finally, restart the servier `service ddclient restart`
